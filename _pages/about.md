Welcome! I am a Data Scientist at one of the world-leading microchip semiconductor manufacturers, and 
currently work on predictive maintenance and image classification projects. 

Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Data Science from the University of Bristol where I wrote
my thesis with [Dave Cliff](https:https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/dave-cliff), and 
my B.Sc. in IT with a major in Computing and Business where I was co-advised by 
[Michel Camilleri](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/michelcamilleri) and
[John Abela](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/johnabela).

In my free time, I participate in kaggle competitions, add fun visualisations to my portfolio, 
and read about science, gastronomy, and education.
